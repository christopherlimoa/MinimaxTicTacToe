# Unbeatable TicTacToe Player

This TicTacToe AI cannot be beaten as the player can only lose or draw. Minimax algorithm is used to calculate the best move for the computer AI to take.

The project is created using **<span style="color:red">_p5.js_</span>** library. This includes the sketch and underlying algorithm that support the behaviour of the game.
